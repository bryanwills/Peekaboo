# `peekaboo press`

`press` fires individual `SpecialKey` values (Return, Tab, arrows, F-keys, etc.) in sequence through the hotkey service. Background process-targeted delivery is the default when Peekaboo can resolve a target process; pass `--foreground` for focused/global key presses.

## Key options
| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `[keys…]` | Positional list of keys (`return`, `tab`, `up`, `f1`, `forward_delete`, …). Validation rejects unknown tokens. |
| `--count <n>` | Repeat the entire key sequence `n` times (default `1`). |
| `--delay <ms>` | Delay between key presses (default `100`). |
| `--hold <ms>` | Hold duration per key (default `50`). |
| `--snapshot <id>` | Optional snapshot ID used for validation/focus (no implicit “latest snapshot” lookup). |
| Target flags | `--app <name>`, `--pid <pid>`, `--window-id <id>`, `--window-title <title>`, `--window-index <n>` — send key presses to a specific app/window in the background when possible. (`--window-title`/`--window-index` require `--app` or `--pid`; `--window-id` does not.) |
| `--foreground` | Focus target and send foreground/global key presses. Focus flags also imply foreground delivery. |
| Focus flags | Foreground focus controls; same `FocusCommandOptions` bundle as `click`/`type`. |

## Implementation notes
- Keys are lowercased and mapped to `SpecialKey`; the command fails fast with a helpful message if a token isn’t recognized.
- Without a resolvable snapshot or target process, key presses fall back to foreground/global delivery to the current focus.
- Repetition multiplies the sequence client-side—e.g., `press tab return --count 3` becomes six actions—so you get predictable ordering.
- Results include the literal key list, total presses, repeat count, delivery mode, optional target PID, and elapsed time in both text and JSON modes.
- The `--hold` flag is passed to the hotkey service for each key press.

## Examples
```bash
# Equivalent to hitting Return once
peekaboo press return

# Tab through a menu twice, then confirm
peekaboo press tab tab return

# Walk a dialog down three rows with headroom between repetitions
peekaboo press down --count 3 --delay 200

# Send Return to TextEdit without bringing it forward
peekaboo press return --app TextEdit
```

## Troubleshooting
- Verify Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions (`peekaboo permissions status`). Background key presses also require Event Synthesizing access for the sending process; request it with `peekaboo permissions request-event-synthesizing`.
- Confirm your target (app/window/selector) with `peekaboo list`/`peekaboo see` before rerunning.
- If you see `SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND`, regenerate the snapshot with `peekaboo see` (or omit `--snapshot` to use the most recent one).
- Re-run with `--json` or `--verbose` to surface detailed errors.
